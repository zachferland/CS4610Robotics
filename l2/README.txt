BUGS OR INCOMPLETENESS ******

During our demo we didn't have the image server properly running  with global nav, 
but with the time betwen demo and submission we were able to implement the image 
server for global nav.

Note - the global nav currently doesn not take the boundary rectangle into consideration
when determining a path.

[NICK ANYTHING HERE ?]


CONTRIBUTION ***************

We spent a lot time working together on various parts. But Zach mainly focused on the implementing the Global Nav, Nick on the Local Nav and Qimeng on the Image Server.
